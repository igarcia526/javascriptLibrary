    <div class= "title1"><P>WHAT HELPS ME LEARN CODE?</P> </div>
    <div class= "headers"><h1 class= "headers">YOUTUBE</h1></div>
    <p>Watching videos on youtube helps me grasp difficult conscepts much easier than sitting in a lecture. Short detailed videos help me stay focused on the subject. </p>
    <h2 class= "headers"> OTHER'S CODE</h2>
    <p2>Looking at other people's code is a great way to see how code works, and helps me develop good coding habits. Looking at others' code is a great way to learn new things!</p2>
    
    <div class= "title2"><p>WHAT DO I STRUGGLE WITH THE MOST?</p></div>
    <h3 class= "headers">REMEMBERING COMMANDS</h3>
    <P3>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all have their own keywords and tags, sometimes remembering all those words and what they are used for can be a bit overwhelming, thankfully we have GOOGLE!</P3>
    <h4 class= "headers">PUTTING IT TO USE</h4>
    <p4>Its a great feeling when you finally understand a subject youve been struggling with, yet this awesome feeling can sometimes be overshadowed when you cant think of a way to use your new-found knowledge. This is why looking at other people's code can be helpful!</p4>
